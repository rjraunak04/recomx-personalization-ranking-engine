# Day-07 — Productionization and Observability

## CP-01: Production runtime contract

RecomX now has an explicit environment-driven serving runtime contract. Runtime configuration separates deployment concerns from recommendation logic and validates environment, host, port, required artifact locations, readiness, and locked-test isolation.

The production runtime requires the Day-05 ranking model, ranking features, chronological training ratings, and MovieLens metadata. Readiness exposes artifact availability by filename only so local filesystem roots are not leaked.

The locked test partition is forbidden from production-serving configuration. Day-07 continues to use only already-approved development/serving artifacts.
